# Database Systems

Lab work and term project for Database Systems accomplished using SQL, Unix Shell, and Java.

Advanced file management techniques involving fundamentals of database organization, design and management. Emphasis is given to Relational Database Management Systems including relational algebra, normal Forms, physical Database Structures and their implementation, and Relational Database Languages. Other types of Database Managers are also discussed such as Hierarchical, Network and Inverted Files.

# Project (Hotel Management System) Overview:

1. Database Schema Design: Defines the database schema for managing various aspects of a hotel, including amenities, guests, rooms, departments, employees, and facilitates             
   relationships between them.
  
2. Normalization: The database schema is normalized up to BCNF to ensure efficient storage, minimize redundancy, and maintain data integrity.
   
3. SQL Queries: A wide range of SQL queries is provided to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from the database. These queries enable various functionalities such as managing       guests, rooms, employees, departments, and amenities.
   
4. Relational Algebra: Relational algebra expressions are provided alongside SQL queries, demonstrating the theoretical foundation of relational databases and equivalent operations.
   Unix Shell Implementation: Shell scripts are included to facilitate database management tasks such as table creation, data population, query execution, and table deletion using Unix    shell commands.
   
5. Java UI: A Java program is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the hotel management system. It connects to the Oracle database, executes SQL queries,    and performs CRUD operations on tables.

Overall, the hotel management system project demonstrates a robust solution for managing various aspects of a hotel's operations, ranging from guest management to room allocation and employee scheduling. It integrates theoretical concepts with practical implementation using SQL, Unix Shell, and Java programming.
